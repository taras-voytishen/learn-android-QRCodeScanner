# learn-android-QRCodeScanner
It's a small project for train my android skills

I take idea from upwork, let present you job detail:

An app that will automatically scan products QR Codes when opened, and verify if the codes exist in our database not, and return a message whether found or not.
Eg. of returned message if code is found " Original XXX product, made by XXXX Ltd. Thanks for your patronage'
Eg. of nonexistence code "This product is not found in our database. Please beware of fake product purchase".

Once the app is opened and camera is pointed at the QR Code, it should automatically capture the code. There should be an option to input the code manually.
